# Welcome

Hello there and welcome to our public github repository for the FiveM server we host. This github was put together for the users who are interested in and play on our FiveM project. It gives you all a space to report issues, submit ideas, and see what we are working on / have completed. Take a look around and stop on by the discord if you need any help.

## I need help!

The two best places to get help are the Wiki here on the github and our discord server. You can get help with using this github, navigating the server, and sooo much more. For reporting issues or bugs, giving new ideas, or checking our developers work, check out the Issues and Projects buttons above.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/x0Z3ro0x/FiveM-Server-PUBLIC/wiki) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ7KMAe) for more information.
